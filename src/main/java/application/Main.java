    Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

    This problem was asked by Spotify.

    Write a function, throw_dice(N, faces, total), that determines how many ways it is possible to throw N dice with some number of faces each to get a specific total.

    For example, throw_dice(3, 6, 7) should equal 15.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        throw_dice(3, 6, 7);



    }

    public static String throw_dice(int throwNdice, int faces, int total) {
        return  null;
    }


}
